  We consider the strongly connected components (SCC) of a uniform directed graph on $n$ vertices with i.i.d. degree tuples distributed as $(D^-,D^+)$, with $\E[D^+]=\E[D^-]=\mu$. We condition on the total in-degree and total out-degree to be equal. A phase transition for the emergence of a giant strongly connected component, that contains a positive proportion of the vertices, is known to occur at the critical value $\E[D^-D^+]/\mu=1$. We study the model at this critical value, and additionally, require that $\E[(D^-)^i(D^+)^j]<\infty$ for all $i+j\leq 3$, and for $i=3$, $j=1$. We show that, under these conditions, the strongly connected components ranked by decreasing order of size and rescaled by $n^{-1/3}$, converge in distribution to a sequence of finite strongly connected directed multigraphs with edge lengths which are either $3$-regular or loops. The limit objects are in a $3$-parameter family, which contains the scaling limit of the SCC in the directed Erd\H{o}s-Renyi model at criticality as found in \cite{goldschmidtScalingLimitCritical2019}. This shows that the limit object is universal, and makes this the first universality result for directed graph models. Moreover, this is the first time result on the directed configuration model at criticality. As a trivial consequence, the largest strongly connected components at criticality contain $O(n^{1/3})$ vertices with high probability, and the diameter of the directed graph at criticality is $\Omega(n^{1/3})$ with high probability; two results that were previously unknown.  We use a metric on the space of such multigraphs in which two multigraphs are close if there are compatible isomorphisms between their vertex and edge sets which roughly preserves the edge lengths. We use the product topology on the sequence of multigraphs. Our method involves depth-first exploration of the directed graph, resulting in a spanning forest, of which we study the limit under rescaling.
