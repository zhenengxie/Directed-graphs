The continuum analogue of discrete trees are given by $\R$-trees. A survey paper on $\R$-trees can be found in \myworries{insert Le Gall reference}. An $\R$-tree is a compact metric space $(\cT, d)$ such that for every $a, b \in \cT$ the following two properties hold:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item There exists a unique isometry $f_{a, b} : [0, d(a, b)] \to \cT$ such that $f_{a, b}(0) = a$ and $f_{a, b}(d(a, b)) = b$.
    \item If $q: [0, 1] \to \cT$ is any continuous map such that $q(0) = a$ and $q(1) = b$ then the image of $q$ is the same as the image of $f_{a, b}$.
\end{enumerate}
Let $\pathbtw{a, b}$ denote the image of $f_{a, b}$. This is the unique path between $a$ and $b$.
