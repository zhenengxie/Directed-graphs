In \cref{fig:largest-sccs} \myworries{actually generate sccs from a poisson model} we see the largest SCC from samples of a directed configuration model. As can be seen, while the lengths of paths in the SCC are long, the actual structure of the SCC is often quite simple. In some cases the largest SCC is just a single cycle.  This was confirmed in previous work by \myworries{insert reference for DER}. There it was shown that while the lengths of paths in the SCC will scale like $n^{1/3}$, the actual structure of the SCC will remain finite.

To formalise this idea we will introduce metric directed multigraphs (MDMs). These are simply weighted directed multigraphs, but in our context it is more appropriate to think of the weights as lengths hence the change in naming. Formally a directed multigraph is a tuple $M = (V, E, r)$ where
