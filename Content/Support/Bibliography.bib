These formulae explain why in certain cases (gamma and stable) the size-biased permutation of the normalized jumps of a subordinator can be represented by a stickbreaking (residual allocation) scheme defined by independent beta random variables. An application is made to length biased sampling of excursions of a Markov process away from a recurrent point of its statespace, with emphasis on the Brownian and Bessel cases when the associated inverse local time is a stable subordinator. Results in this case are linked to generalizations of the arcsine law for the fraction of time spent positive by Brownian motion.},

This branch of modern probability theory has been developed over recent years and has many applications in such areas as queues, mathematical finance and risk estimation. Professor Bertoin has used the powerful interplay between the probabilistic structure (independence and stationarity of the increments) and analytic tools (especially Fourier and Laplace transforms) to give a quick and concise treatment of the core theory, with the minimum of technical requirements. Special properties of subordinators are developed and then appear as key features in the study of the local times of real-valued Levy processes and in fluctuation theory.

abstract = {Consider the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the complete graph with n vertices, when edges are assigned independent random weights. Endow this tree with the graph distance renormalized by n{\^{}}{\{}1/3{\}} and with the uniform measure on its vertices. We show that the resulting space converges in distribution, as n tends to infinity, to a random measured metric space in the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov topology. We additionally show that the limit is a random binary R-tree and has Minkowski dimension 3 almost surely. In particular, its law is mutually singular with that of the Brownian continuum random tree or any rescaled version thereof. Our approach relies on a coupling between the MST problem and the Erd$\backslash$"os-R$\backslash$'enyi random graph. We exploit the explicit description of the scaling limit of the Erd$\backslash$"os-R$\backslash$'enyi random graph in the so-called critical window, established by the first three authors in an earlier paper, and provide a similar description of the scaling limit for a "critical minimum spanning forest" contained within the MST.},

@article{Duquesne2006,
abstract = {This paper is a detailled study of the coding of real trees by real valued functions that is motivated by probabilistic problems related to continuum random trees. Indeed it is known since the works of Aldous (1993) and Le Gall (1991) that a continuous non-negative function {\$}h{\$} on {\$}[0,1]{\$} such that {\$}h(0)=0{\$} can be seen as the contour process of a compact real tree. This particular coding of a compact real tree provides additional structures, namely a root that is the vertex corresponding to {\$}0\backslashin [0,1]{\$}, a linear order inherited from the usual order on {\$}[0,1]{\$} and a measure induced by the Lebesgue measure on {\$}[0,1]{\$}; of course, the root, the linear order and the measure obtained by such a coding have to satisfy some compatibility conditions. In this paper, we prove that any compact real tree equipped with a root, a linear order and a measure that are compatible can be encoded by a non-negative function {\$}h{\$} defined on a finite interval {\$}[0, M]{\$}, that is assumed to be left-continuous with right-limit, without positive jump and such that {\$}h(0+)=h(0)=0{\$}. Moreover, this function is unique if we assume that the exploration of the tree induced by such a coding backtracks as less as possible. We also prove that a measure-change on the tree corresponds to a re-parametrization of the coding function. In addition, we describe several path-properties of the coding function in terms of the metric properties of the real tree.},

For several years I have been interested in what kinds of “general theory” (as opposed to {\textless}span class='italic'{\textgreater}ad hoc{\textless}/span{\textgreater} analysis of particular models) might be useful in studying asymptotics of random trees. In this paper, aimed at theoretical probabilists, I discuss aspects of this incipient general theory which are most closely related to topics of current interest in theoretical stochastic processes. No prior knowledge of this subject is assumed: the paper is intended as an introduction and survey.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}To give the really big picture in a paragraph, consider a tree on {\textless}span class='italic'{\textgreater}n{\textless}/span{\textgreater} vertices. View the vertices as points in abstract (rather than {\textless}span class='italic'{\textgreater}d{\textless}/span{\textgreater}-dimensional) space, but let the edges have length (= 1, as a default) so that there is metric structure: the distance between two vertices is the length of the path between them. Consider the average distance between pairs of vertices. As {\textless}span class='italic'{\textgreater}n{\textless}/span{\textgreater} → ∞ this average distance could stay bounded or could grow as order {\textless}span class='italic'{\textgreater}n{\textless}/span{\textgreater}, but almost all natural random trees fall into one of two categories. In the first (and larger) category, the average distance grows as order logn. This category includes supercritical branching processes, and most “Markovian growth” models such as those occurring in the analysis of algorithms. This paper is concerned with the second category, in which the average distance grows as order {\textless}span class='italic'{\textgreater}n{\textless}/span{\textgreater}{\textless}span class='sup'{\textgreater}½{\textless}/span{\textgreater}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}},

This identity yields a pathwise construction of X conditioned (in the sense of harmonic transform) to stay positive or negative, from which we recover the extension of Pitman's theorem for downwards-skip-free processes. We also extend for L{\'{e}}vy processes an identity that Karatzas and Shreve obtained for the Brownian motion.

Leaf-length erasure, also called trimming, is included as a special case of hereditary reduction. We only consider the metric structure of trees, and our framework is the space {\$}\backslashbT{\$} of pointed isometry classes of locally compact rooted real trees equipped with the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. Some of the main results of the paper are a general tightness criterion in {\$}\backslashbT{\$} and limit theorems for growing families of trees. We apply these results to Galton-Watson trees with exponentially distributed edge lengths. This class is preserved by hereditary reduction. Then we consider families of such Galton-Watson trees that are consistent under hereditary reduction and that we call growth processes. We prove that the associated families of offspring distributions are completely characterised by the branching mechanism of a continuous-state branching process. We also prove that such growth processes converge to Levy forests. As a by-product of this convergence, we obtain a characterisation of the laws of Levy forests in terms of leaf-length erasure and we obtain invariance principles for discrete Galton-Watson trees, including the super-critical cases.},

abstract = {Combinatorial trees can be used to represent genealogies of asexual individuals. These individuals can be endowed with birth and death times, to obtain a so-called `chronological tree'. In this work, we are interested in the continuum analogue of chronological trees in the setting of real trees. This leads us to consider totally ordered and measured trees, abbreviated as TOM trees. First, we define an adequate space of TOM trees and prove that under some mild conditions, every compact TOM tree can be represented in a unique way by a so-called contour function, which is right-continuous, admits limits from the left and has non-negative jumps. The appropriate notion of contour function is also studied in the case of locally compact TOM trees. Then we study the splitting property of (measures on) TOM trees which extends the notion of `splitting tree' studied in $\backslash$cite{\{}MR2599603{\}}, where during her lifetime, each individual gives birth at constant rate to independent and identically distributed copies of herself. We prove that the contour function of a TOM tree satisfying the splitting property is associated to a spectrally positive L$\backslash$'evy process that is not a subordinator, both in the critical and subcritical cases of compact trees as well as in the supercritical case of locally compact trees.},

abstract = {We study the critical behavior of the component sizes for the configuration model when the tail of the degree distribution of a randomly chosen vertex is a regularly-varying function with exponent {\$}\backslashtau-1{\$}, where {\$}\backslashtau\backslashin (3,4){\$}. The component sizes are shown to be of the order {\$}n{\^{}}{\{}(\backslashtau-2)/(\backslashtau-1){\}}L(n){\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} for some slowly-varying function {\$}L(\backslashcdot){\$}. We show that the re-scaled ordered component sizes converge in distribution to the ordered excursions of a thinned L$\backslash$'evy process. This proves that the scaling limits for the component sizes for these heavy-tailed configuration models are in a different universality class compared to the Erd$\backslash$H{\{}o{\}}s-R$\backslash$'enyi random graphs. Also the joint re-scaled vector of ordered component sizes and their surplus edges is shown to have a distributional limit under a strong topology. Our proof resolves a conjecture by Joseph, Ann. Appl. Probab. (2014) about the scaling limits of uniform simple graphs with i.i.d degrees in the critical window, and sheds light on the relation between the scaling limits obtained by Joseph and this paper, which appear to be quite different. Further, we use percolation to study the evolution of the component sizes and the surplus edges within the critical scaling window, which is shown to converge in finite dimension to the augmented multiplicative coalescent process introduced by Bhamidi et. al., Probab. Theory Related Fields (2014). The main results of this paper are proved under rather general assumptions on the vertex degrees. We also discuss how these assumptions are satisfied by some of the frameworks that have been studied previously.},

abstract = {We investigate the genealogical structure of general critical or subcritical continuous-state branching processes. Analogously to the coding of a discrete tree by its contour function, this genealogical structure is coded by a real-valued stochastic process called the height process, which is itself constructed as a local time functional of a Levy process with no negative jumps. We present a detailed study of the height process and of an associated measure-valued process called the exploration process, which plays a key role in most applications. Under suitable assumptions, we prove that whenever a sequence of rescaled Galton-Watson processes converges in distribution, their genealogies also converge to the continuous branching structure coded by the appropriate height process. We apply this invariance principle to various asymptotics for Galton-Watson trees. We then use the duality properties of the exploration process to compute explicitly the distribution of the reduced tree associated with Poissonnian marks in the height process, and the finite-dimensional marginals of the so-called stable continuous tree. This last calculation generalizes to the stable case a result of Aldous for the Brownian continuum random tree. Finally, we combine the genealogical structure with an independent spatial motion to develop a new approach to superprocesses with a general branching mechanism. In this setting, we derive certain explicit distributions, such as the law of the spatial reduced tree in a domain, consisting of the collection of all historical paths that hit the boundary.},

For l ≥ -1 define an l-component of a random graph as a component which has exactly l more edges than vertices. Call an l-component with l ≥ 1 a complex component. For both models, we show that when $\lambda$ is constant, the expected number of complex components is bounded, almost surely (a.s.) each of these components (if any exist) has size of order n2/3, and the maximum value of l is bounded in probability. We prove that a.s. the largest suspended tree in each complex component has size of order n2/3, and deletion of all suspended trees results in a "smoothed" graph of size of order n1/3, with the maximum vertex degree 3. The total number of branching vertices, i.e., of degree 3, is bounded in probability. Thus, each complex component is almost surely topologically equivalent to a 3-regular multigraph of a uniformly bounded size. Lengths of the shortest cycle and of the shortest path between two branching vertices of a smoothed graph are each of order n1/3. We find a relatively simple integral formula for the limit distribution of the numbers of complex components, which implies, in particular, that all values of the "complexity spectrum" have positive limiting probabilities. We also answer questions raised by Erd{\"{o}}s and R{\'{e}}nyi back in 1960. It is proven that there exists p($\lambda$), the limiting planarity probability, with 0 {\textless} p($\lambda$) {\textless} 1, p(-∞) = 1, p(∞) = 0. In particular, G(n, M) (G(n, p), resp.) is almost surely nonplanar iff {\$}(M-n/2)n{\^{}}{\{}-2/3{\}}\backslashrightarrow \backslashinfty \backslash ((np-1)n{\^{}}{\{}-1/3{\}})\backslashrightarrow \backslashinfty {\$}, resp.).},

The aim of this paper is to examine in detail the structure of a random graph {\$}G{\_}M{\$} when {\$}M{\$} is close to {\$}n/2{\$}.

abstract="We construct random locally compact real trees called L{\'e}vy trees that are the genealogical trees associated with continuous-state branching processes. More precisely, we define a growing family of discrete Galton--Watson trees with i.i.d. exponential branch lengths that is consistent under Bernoulli percolation on leaves; we define the L{\'e}vy tree as the limit of this growing family with respect to the Gromov--Hausdorff topology on metric spaces. This elementary approach notably includes supercritical trees and does not make use of the height process introduced by Le Gall and Le Jan to code the genealogy of (sub)critical continuous-state branching processes. We construct the mass measure of L{\'e}vy trees and we give a decomposition along the ancestral subtree of a Poisson sampling directed by the mass measure.",

	Abstract = {Let (Bs, s≥ 0) be a standard Brownian motion and T1 its first passage time at level 1. For every t≥ 0, we consider ladder time set ℒ(t)of the Brownian motion with drift t, B(t)s= Bs+ ts, and the decreasing sequence F(t) = (F1(t), F2(t), {\ldots}) of lengths of the intervals of the random partition of [0, T1] induced by ℒ(t). The main result of this work is that (F(t), t≥ 0) is a fragmentation process, in the sense that for 0 ≤t < t{\textasciiacutex}, F(t{\textasciiacutex}) is obtained from F(t) by breaking randomly into pieces each component of F(t) according to a law that only depends on the length of this component, and independently of the others. We identify the fragmentation law with the one that appears in the construction of the standard additive coalescent by Aldous and Pitman [3].},

	Abstract = {We study a natural fragmentation process of the so-called stable tree introduced by Duquesne and Le Gall, which consists in removing the nodes of the tree according to a certain procedure that makes the fragmentation self-similar with positive index. Explicit formulas for the semigroup are given, and we provide asymptotic results. We also give an alternative construction of this fragmentation, using paths of L{\'e}vy processes, hence echoing the two alternative constructions of the standard additive coalescent by fragmenting the Brownian continuum random tree or using Brownian paths, respectively due to Aldous-Pitman and Bertoin.},

 abstract = {Regard an element of the set Δ: = {(x1, x2,...): x1 ≥ x2 ≥ ⋯ ≥ 0, ∑i xi = 1} as a fragmentation of unit mass into clusters of masses xi. The additive coalescent of Evans and Pitman is the Δ-valued Markov process in which pairs of clusters of masses {xi, xj} merge into a cluster of mass xi + xj at rate xi + xj. They showed that a version $(X^\infty(t), -\infty < t < \infty)$ of this process arises as a n → ∞ weak limit of the process started at time -1/2 log n with n clusters of mass 1/n. We show this standard additive coalescent may be constructed from the continuum random tree of Aldous by Poisson splitting along the skeleton of the tree. We describe the distribution of X∞(t) on Δ at a fixed time t. We show that the size of the cluster containing a given atom, as a process in t, has a simple representation in terms of the stable subordinator of index 1/2. As t → -∞, we establish a Gaussian limit for (centered and normalized) cluster sizes and study the size of the largest cluster.},

abstract = {The real trees form a class of metric spaces that extends the class of trees with edge lengths by allowing behavior such as infinite total edge length and vertices with infinite branching degree. Aldous's Brownian continuum random tree, the random tree-like object naturally associated with a standard Brownian excursion, may be thought of as a random compact real tree. The continuum random tree is a scaling limit as N →∞ of both a critical Galton-Watson tree conditioned to have total population size N as well as a uniform random rooted combinatorial tree with N vertices. The Aldous–Broder algorithm is a Markov chain on the space of rooted combinatorial trees with N vertices that has the uniform tree as its stationary distribution. We construct and study a Markov process on the space of all rooted compact real trees that has the continuum random tree as its stationary distribution and arises as the scaling limit as N →∞ of the Aldous–Broder chain. A key technical ingredient in this work is the use of a pointed Gromov–Hausdorff distance to metrize the space of rooted compact real trees.
