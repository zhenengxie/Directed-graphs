We prove that the sequence of connected components of G(n, p), considered as metric spaces using the graph distance rescaled by n-1/3, converges towards a sequence of continuous compact metric spaces. The result relies on a bijection between graphs and certain marked random walks, and the theory of continuum random trees. Our result gives access to the answers to a great many questions about distances in critical random graphs. In particular, we deduce that the diameter of G(n, p) rescaled by n-1/3 converges in distribution to an absolutely continuous random variable with finite mean.},

We proved in [1] that considering the connected components of \$G(n,p)\$ as a sequence of metric spaces with the graph distance rescaled by \$n\^\{-1/3\}\$ and letting \$n\textbackslash to\textbackslash infty\$ yields a non-trivial sequence of limit metric spaces \$C=(C\_1,C\_2,\textbackslash ldots)\$. These limit metric spaces can be constructed from certain random real trees with vertex-identifications. For a single such metric space, we give here two equivalent constructions, both of which are in terms of more standard probabilistic objects. The first is a global construction using Dirichlet random variables and Aldous' Brownian continuum random tree. The second is a recursive construction from an inhomogeneous Poisson point process on \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\_+\$. These constructions allow us to characterize the distributions of the masses and lengths in the constituent parts of a limit component when it is decomposed according to its cycle structure. In particular, this strengthens results of [29] by providing precise distributional convergence for the lengths of paths between kernel vertices and the length of a shortest cycle, within any fixed limit component},

  month = jun,
  abstract = {We consider fragmentations of an R-tree \$T\$ driven by cuts arriving according to a Poisson process on \$T \textbackslash times [0, \textbackslash infty)\$, where the first co-ordinate specifies the location of the cut and the second the time at which it occurs. The genealogy of such a fragmentation is encoded by the so-called cut-tree, which was introduced by Bertoin and Miermont for a fragmentation of the Brownian continuum random tree. The cut-tree was generalised by Dieuleveut to a fragmentation of the \$\textbackslash alpha\$-stable trees, \$\textbackslash alpha \textbackslash in (1, 2)\$, and by Broutin and Wang to the inhomogeneous continuum random trees of Aldous and Pitman. Remarkably, in all of these cases, the law of the cut-tree is the same as that of the original R-tree. In this paper, we develop a clean general framework for the study of cut-trees of R-trees. We then focus particularly on the problem of reconstruction: how to recover the original R-tree from its cut-tree. This has been studied in the setting of the Brownian CRT by Broutin and Wang, where they prove that it is possible to reconstruct the original tree in distribution. We describe an enrichment of the cut-tree transformation, which endows the cut tree with information we call a consistent collection of routings. We show this procedure is well-defined under minimal conditions on the R-trees. We then show that, for the case of the Brownian CRT and the \$\textbackslash alpha\$-stable trees with \$\textbackslash alpha \textbackslash in (1, 2)\$, the original tree and the Poisson process of cuts thereon can both be almost surely reconstructed from the enriched cut-trees. For the latter results, our methods make essential use of the self-similarity and re-rooting invariance of these trees.},

Endow this tree with the graph distance renormalized by n\^\{1/3\} and with the uniform measure on its vertices. We show that the resulting space converges in distribution, as n tends to infinity, to a random measured metric space in the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov topology. We additionally show that the limit is a random binary R-tree and has Minkowski dimension 3 almost surely. In particular, its law is mutually singular with that of the Brownian continuum random tree or any rescaled version thereof. Our approach relies on a coupling between the MST problem and the Erd\textbackslash "os-R\textbackslash 'enyi random graph. We exploit the explicit description of the scaling limit of the Erd\textbackslash "os-R\textbackslash 'enyi random graph in the so-called critical window, established by the first three authors in an earlier paper, and provide a similar description of the scaling limit for a "critical minimum spanning forest" contained within the MST.},

  abstract = {We show how to extend a recently proposed multi-level Monte Carlo approach to the continuous time Markov chain setting, thereby greatly lowering the computational complexity needed to compute expected values of functions of the state of the system to a specified accuracy. The extension is non-trivial, exploiting a coupling of the requisite processes that is easy to simulate while providing a small variance for the estimator. Further, and in a stark departure from other implementations of multi-level Monte Carlo, we show how to produce an unbiased estimator that is significantly less computationally expensive than the usual unbiased estimator arising from exact algorithms in conjunction with crude Monte Carlo. We thereby dramatically improve, in a quantifiable manner, the basic computational complexity of current approaches that have many names and variants across the scientific literature, including the Bortz-Kalos-Lebowitz algorithm, discrete event simulation, dynamic Monte Carlo, kinetic Monte Carlo, the n-fold way, the next reaction method,the residence-time algorithm, the stochastic simulation algorithm, Gillespie's algorithm, and tau-leaping. The new algorithm applies generically, but we also give an example where the coupling idea alone, even without a multi-level discretization, can be used to improve efficiency by exploiting system structure. Stochastically modeled chemical reaction networks provide a very important application for this work. Hence, we use this context for our notation, terminology, natural scalings, and computational examples.},

This article presents a scaling limit for a DNN being trained by stochastic gradient descent. Our networks have a fixed (but arbitrary) number \$L\textbackslash geq 2\$ of inner layers; \$N\textbackslash gg 1\$ neurons per layer; full connections between layers; and fixed weights (or "random features" that are not trained) near the input and output. Our results describe the evolution of the DNN during training in the limit when \$N\textbackslash to +\textbackslash infty\$, which we relate to a mean field model of McKean-Vlasov type. Specifically, we show that network weights are approximated by certain "ideal particles" whose distribution and dependencies are described by the mean-field model. A key part of the proof is to show existence and uniqueness for our McKean-Vlasov problem, which does not seem to be amenable to existing theory. Our paper extends previous work on the \$L=1\$ case by Mei, Montanari and Nguyen; Rotskoff and Vanden-Eijnden; and Sirignano and Spiliopoulos. We also complement recent independent work on \$L{$>$}1\$ by Sirignano and Spiliopoulos (who consider a less natural scaling limit) and Nguyen (who nonrigorously derives similar results).},

The number of blocks of each of the different possible sizes in this partition is the allele frequency spectrum. The celebrated Ewens sampling formula gives precise probabilities for the allele frequency spectrum associated with Kingman's coalescent. This (and the degenerate star-shaped coalescent) are the only Lambda coalescents for which explicit probabilities are known, although they are known to satisfy a recursion due to Moehle. Recently, Berestycki, Berestycki and Schweinsberg have proved asymptotic results for the allele frequency spectra of the Beta(2-alpha,alpha) coalescents with alpha in (1,2). In this paper, we prove full asymptotics for the case of the Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent.},

The goal is to investigate the growth of the model space under parameter variation. In particular, we prove several results in the approaching subcriticality limit leading to universal growth exponents of the regularity structure. A key role is played by the viewpoint that model spaces can be identified with families of rooted trees. Our proofs are based upon a geometrical construction similar to Newton polygons for classical Taylor series and various combinatorial arguments. We also present several explicit examples listing all elements with negative homogeneity by implementing a new symbolic software package to work with regularity structures. We use this package to illustrate our analytical results and to obtain new conjectures regarding coarse-grained network measures for model spaces.},

  abstract = {The last few years have witnessed tremendous interest in understanding the structure as well as the behavior of dynamics for inhomogeneous random graph models to gain insight into real-world systems. In this study we analyze the maximal components at criticality of one famous class of such models, the rank-one inhomogeneous random graph model (Norros and Reittu, Adv Appl Probab 38(1):59\textendash 75, 2006; Bollob\'as et al., Random Struct Algorithms 31(1):3\textendash 122, 2007, Section~16.4). Viewing these components as measured random metric spaces, under finite moment assumptions for the weight distribution, we show that the components in the critical scaling window with distances scaled by \$\$n\^\{-1/3\}\$\$converge in the Gromov\textendash Haussdorf\textendash Prokhorov metric to rescaled versions of the limit objects identified for the Erd\H{o}s\textendash R\'enyi random graph components at criticality in Addario-Berry et al. (Probab. Theory Related Fields, 152(3\textendash 4):367\textendash 406, 2012). A key step is the construction of connected components of the random graph through an appropriate tilt of a fundamental class of random trees called \$\$\textbackslash mathbf \{p\}\$\$-trees (Camarri and Pitman, Electron. J. Probab 5(2):1\textendash 18, 2000; Aldous et al., Probab Theory Related Fields 129(2):182\textendash 218, 2004). This is the first step in rigorously understanding the scaling limits of objects such as the minimal spanning tree and other strong disorder models from statistical physics (Braunstein et al., Phys Rev Lett 91(16):168701, 2003) for such graph models. By asymptotic equivalence (Janson, Random Struct Algorithms 36(1):26\textendash 45, 2010), the same results are true for the Chung\textendash Lu model (Chung and Lu, Proc Natl Acad Sci 99(25):15879\textendash 15882, 2002; Chung and Lu, Ann Combin 6(2):125\textendash 145, 2002; Chung and Lu, Complex graphs and networks, 2006) and the Britton\textendash Deijfen\textendash Martin\textendash L\"of model (Britton et al., J Stat Phys 124(6):1377\textendash 1397, 2006). A crucial ingredient of the proof of independent interest are tail bounds for the height of \$\$\textbackslash mathbf \{p\}\$\$-trees. The techniques developed in this paper form the main technical bedrock for the general program developed in Bhamidi et al. (Scaling limits of random graph models at criticality: Universality and the basin of attraction of the Erd\H{o}s\textendash R\'enyi random graph. arXiv preprint, 2014) for proving universality of the continuum scaling limits in the critical regime for a wide array of other random graph models including the configuration model and inhomogeneous random graphs with general kernels (Bollob\'as et al., Random Struct Algorithms 31(1):3\textendash 122, 2007).},

  abstract = {Over the last few years a wide array of random graph models have been postulated to understand properties of empirically observed networks. Most of these models come with a parameter \$t\$ (usually related to edge density) and a (model dependent) critical time \$t\_c\$ which specifies when a giant component emerges. There is evidence to support that for a wide class of models, under moment conditions, the nature of this emergence is universal and looks like the classical Erd\textbackslash H\{o\}s-R\textbackslash 'enyi random graph, in the sense of the critical scaling window and (a) the sizes of the components in this window (all maximal component sizes scaling like \$n\^\{2/3\}\$) and (b) the structure of components (rescaled by \$n\^\{-1/3\}\$) converge to random fractals related to the continuum random tree. Till date, (a) has been proven for a number of models using different techniques while (b) has been proven for only two models, the classical Erd\textbackslash H\{o\}s-R\textbackslash 'enyi random graph and the rank-1 inhomogeneous random graph. The aim of this paper is to develop a general program for proving such results. The program requires three main ingredients: (i) in the critical scaling window, components merge approximately like the multiplicative coalescent (ii) scaling exponents of susceptibility functions are the same as the Erd\textbackslash H\{o\}s-R\textbackslash 'enyi random graph and (iii) macroscopic averaging of expected distances between random points in the same component in the barely subcritical regime. We show that these apply to a number of fundamental random graph models including the configuration model, inhomogeneous random graphs modulated via a finite kernel and bounded size rules. Thus these models all belong to the domain of attraction of the classical Erd\textbackslash H\{o\}s-R\textbackslash 'enyi random graph. As a by product we also get results for component sizes at criticality for a general class of inhomogeneous random graphs.},

  abstract = {The ``classical'' random graph models, in particular G(n,p), are ``homogeneous,'' in the sense that the degrees (for example) tend to be concentrated around a typical value. Many graphs arising in the real world do not have this property, having, for example, power-law degree distributions. Thus there has been a lot of recent interest in defining and studying ``inhomogeneous'' random graph models. One of the most studied properties of these new models is their ``robustness'', or, equivalently, the ``phase transition'' as an edge density parameter is varied. For G(n,p), p = c/n, the phase transition at c = 1 has been a central topic in the study of random graphs for well over 40 years. Many of the new inhomogeneous models are rather complicated; although there are exceptions, in most cases precise questions such as determining exactly the critical point of the phase transition are approachable only when there is independence between the edges. Fortunately, some models studied have this property already, and others can be approximated by models with independence. Here we introduce a very general model of an inhomogeneous random graph with (conditional) independence between the edges, which scales so that the number of edges is linear in the number of vertices. This scaling corresponds to the p = c/n scaling for G(n,p) used to study the phase transition; also, it seems to be a property of many large real-world graphs. Our model includes as special cases many models previously studied. We show that, under one very weak assumption (that the expected number of edges is ``what it should be''), many properties of the model can be determined, in particular the critical point of the phase transition, and the size of the giant component above the transition. We do this by relating our random graphs to branching processes, which are much easier to analyze. We also consider other properties of the model, showing, for example, that when there is a giant component, it is ``stable'': for a typical random graph, no matter how we add or delete o(n) edges, the size of the giant component does not change by more than o(n). \textcopyright{} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This text presents a smooth transition from FA to PDEs by analyzing in great detail the simple case of one-dimensional PDEs (i.e., ODEs), a more manageable approach for the beginner. Although there are many books on functional analysis and many on PDEs, this is the first to cover both of these closely connected topics. Moreover, the wealth of exercises and additional material presented, leads the reader to the frontier of research. This book has its roots in a celebrated course taught by the author for many years and is a completely revised, updated, and expanded English edition of the important ``Analyse Fonctionnelle'' (1983). Since the French book was first published, it has been translated into Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Romanian, Greek and Chinese. The English version is a welcome addition to this list. The first part of the text deals with abstract results in FA and operator theory. The second part is concerned with the study of spaces of functions (of one or more real variables) having specific differentiability properties, e.g., the celebrated Sobolev spaces, which lie at the heart of the modern theory of PDEs. The Sobolev spaces occur in a wide range of questions, both in pure and applied mathematics, appearing in linear and nonlinear PDEs which arise, for example, in differential geometry, harmonic analysis, engineering, mechanics, physics etc. and belong in the toolbox of any graduate student studying analysis.},

  abstract = {We consider a natural model of inhomogeneous random graphs that extends the classical Erd\textbackslash H os-R\textbackslash 'enyi graphs and shares a close connection with the multiplicative coalescence, as pointed out by Aldous [AOP 1997]. In this model, the vertices are assigned weights that govern their tendency to form edges. It is by looking at the asymptotic distributions of the masses (sum of the weights) of the connected components of these graphs that Aldous and Limic [EJP 1998] have identified the entrance boundary of the multiplicative coalescence, which is intimately related to the excursion lengths of certain L\textbackslash 'evy-type processes. We, instead, look at the metric structure of these components and prove their Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov convergence to a class of random compact measured metric spaces that have been introduced in a companion paper. Our asymptotic regimes relate directly to the general convergence condition appearing in the work of Aldous and Limic. Our techniques provide a unified approach for this general "critical" regime, and relies upon two key ingredients: an encoding of the graph by some L\textbackslash 'evy process as well as an embedding of its connected components into Galton-Watson forests. This embedding transfers asymptotically into an embedding of the limit objects into a forest of L\textbackslash 'evy trees, which allows us to give an explicit construction of the limit objects from the excursions of the L\textbackslash 'evy-type process. The mains results combined with the ones in the other paper allow us to extend and complement several previous results that had been obtained via regime-specific proofs, for instance: the case of Erd\textbackslash H os-R\textbackslash 'enyi random graphs obtained by Addario-Berry, Goldschmidt and B.

This is in stark contrast to previous works where one considered regularity structures with a much smaller group of automorphisms, which lead to a much more indirect and convoluted construction of a renormalisation group acting on the corresponding space of admissible models by continuous transformations. Our construction is based on bialgebras of decorated coloured forests in cointeraction. More precisely, we have two Hopf algebras in cointeraction, coacting jointly on a vector space which represents the generalised functions of the theory. Two twisted antipodes play a fundamental role in the construction and provide a variant of the algebraic Birkhoff factorisation that arises naturally in perturbative quantum field theory.},

A consequence of this result is that the sequence of (quadrivariate) ladder processes (both ascending and descending) converges jointly in law toward the ladder processes of X. As an application, we show that in general, the sequence S(n) conditioned to stay positive converges weakly, jointly with its local time at the future minimum, toward the corresponding functional for the limiting process X.

Volume I contains the introductory chapters from the first edition together with an account of basic models, second order theory, and an informal account of prediction, with the aim of making the material accessible to readers primarily interested in models and applications. It also has three appendices that review the mathematical background needed mainly in Volume II. Volume II sets out the basic theory of random measures and point processes in a unified setting and continues with the more theoretical topics of the first edition: limit theorems, ergodic theory, Palm theory, and evolutionary behaviour via martingales and conditional intensity. The very substantial new material in this second volume includes expanded discussions of marked point processes, convergence to equilibrium, and the structure of spatial point processes. D.J. Daley is recently retired from the Centre for Mathematics and Applications at the Australian National University, with research publications in a diverse range of applied probability models and their analysis; he is coauthor with Joe Gani of an introductory text on epidemic modelling.

  abstract = {The theory of large deviations deals with the evaluation, for a family of probability measures parameterized by a real valued variable, of the probabilities of events which decay exponentially in the parameter. Originally developed in the context of statistical mechanics and of (random) dynamical systems, it proved to be a powerful tool in the analysis of systems where the combined effects of random perturbations lead to a behavior significantly different from the noiseless case. The volume complements the central elements of this theory with selected applications in communication and control systems, bio-molecular sequence analysis, hypothesis testing problems in statistics, and the Gibbs conditioning principle in statistical mechanics. Starting with the definition of the large deviation principle (LDP), the authors provide an overview of large deviation theorems in \$\{\{\textbackslash rm I\textbackslash!R\}\}\^d\$ followed by their application. In a more abstract setup where the underlying variables take values in a topological space, the authors provide a collection of methods aimed at establishing the LDP, such as transformations of the LDP, relations between the LDP and Laplace's method for the evaluation for exponential integrals, properties of the LDP in topological vector spaces, and the behavior of the LDP under projective limits. They then turn to the study of the LDP for the sample paths of certain stochastic processes and the application of such LDP's to the problem of the exit of randomly perturbed solutions of differential equations from the domain of attraction of stable equilibria. They conclude with the LDP for the empirical measure of (discrete time) random processes: Sanov's theorem for the empirical measure of an i.i.d. sample, its extensions to Markov processes and mixing sequences and their application. The present soft cover edition is a corrected printing of the 1998 edition. Amir Dembo is a Professor of Mathematics and of Statistics at Stanford University.

Consider the space of partitions of mass (i.e., decreasing sequences of nonnegative real numbers whose sum is 1) and the two-parameter family of Poisson--Dirichlet distributions \$\textbackslash operatorname \{PD\}(\textbackslash alpha,\textbackslash theta)\$ that take values in this space. We introduce families of random fragmentation and coagulation operators \$\textbackslash mathrm \{Frag\}\_\{\textbackslash alpha\}\$ and \$\textbackslash mathrm \{Coag\}\_\{\textbackslash alpha,\textbackslash theta\}\$, respectively, with the following property: if the input to \$\textbackslash mathrm \{Frag\}\_\{\textbackslash alpha\}\$ has \$\textbackslash operatorname \{PD\}(\textbackslash alpha,\textbackslash theta)\$ distribution, then the output has \$\textbackslash operatorname \{PD\}(\textbackslash alpha,\textbackslash theta+1)\$ distribution, while the reverse is true for \$\textbackslash mathrm \{Coag\}\_\{\textbackslash alpha,\textbackslash theta\}\$. This result may be proved using a subordinator representation and it provides a companion set of relations to those of Pitman between \$\textbackslash operatorname \{PD\}(\textbackslash alpha,\textbackslash theta)\$ and \$\textbackslash operatorname \{PD\}(\textbackslash alpha\textbackslash beta,\textbackslash theta)\$. Repeated application of the \$\textbackslash mathrm \{Frag\}\_\{\textbackslash alpha\}\$ operators gives rise to a family of fragmentation chains. We show that these Markov chains can be encoded naturally by certain random recursive trees, and use this representation to give an alternative and more concrete proof of the coagulation--fragmentation duality.},

Operating under the philosophy that the best way to learn probability is to see it in action, the book contains extended examples that apply the theory to concrete applications. This fifth edition contains a new chapter on multidimensional Brownian motion and its relationship to partial differential equations (PDEs), an advanced topic that is finding new applications. Setting the foundation for this expansion, Chapter 7 now features a proof of It\^o's formula. Key exercises that previously were simply proofs left to the reader have been directly inserted into the text as lemmas.

For oriented and unoriented percolation, p=e/np=e/np = e/n and p=1/np=1/np = 1/n are the respective critical probabilities. For oriented first-passage percolation with i.i.d. edge-passage times having a density of 1 near the origin, the percolation time (time to reach the opposite corner of the cube) converges in probability to 1 as n\textrightarrow{$\infty$}n\textrightarrow{$\infty$}n \textbackslash rightarrow \textbackslash infty. This resolves a conjecture of Aldous. When the edge-passage distribution is standard exponential, the (smaller) percolation time for unoriented edges is at least 0.88. These results are applied to Richardson's model on the (unoriented) nnn-cube. Richardson's model, otherwise known as the contact process with no recoveries, models the spread of infection as a Poisson process on each edge connecting an infected node to an uninfected one. It is shown that the time to cover the entire nnn-cube is bounded between 1.41 and 14.05 in probability as n\textrightarrow{$\infty$}n\textrightarrow{$\infty$}n \textbackslash rightarrow \textbackslash infty.},

This textbook presents the first thorough and easily accessible introduction to rough path analysis.When applied to stochastic systems, rough path analysis provides a means to construct a pathwise solution theory which, in many respects, behaves much like the theory of deterministic differential equations and provides a clean break between analytical and probabilistic arguments. It provides a toolbox allowing to recover many classical results without using specific probabilistic properties such as predictability or the martingale property. The study of stochastic PDEs has recently led to a significant extension \textendash{} the theory of regularity structures \textendash{} and the last parts of this book are devoted to a gentle introduction.Most of this course is written as an essentially self-contained textbook, with an emphasis on ideas and short arguments, rather than pushing for the strongest possible statements. A typical reader will have been exposed to upper undergraduate analysis courses and has some interest in stochastic analysis. For a large part of the text, little more than It\^o integration against Brownian motion is required as background.},

We give a detailed limiting description of the distribution of such a fragmentation, \$(F(t), t \textbackslash geq 0)\$, as it approaches its time of extinction, \$\textbackslash zeta\$. In particular, we show that \$t\^\{1/\textbackslash alpha\}F((\textbackslash zeta - t)\^+)\$ converges in distribution as \$t \textbackslash to 0\$ to a non-trivial limit. In order to prove this, we go further and describe the limiting behavior of (a) an excursion of the stable height process (conditioned to have length 1) as it approaches its maximum; (b) the collection of open intervals where the excursion is above a certain level and (c) the ranked sequence of lengths of these intervals. Our principal tool is excursion theory. We also consider the last fragment to disappear and show that, with the same time and space scalings, it has a limiting distribution given in terms of a certain size-biased version of the law of \$\textbackslash zeta\$.},

Each block waits an exponential amount of time with parameter given by its size to some power \$\textbackslash alpha\$, independently of the other blocks. Every block then splits randomly into sub-blocks whose relative sizes are distributed according to the so-called dislocation measure. We focus here on the case where \$\textbackslash alpha{$<$}0\$. In this case, small blocks split intensively, and so the whole state is reduced to "dust" in a finite time, almost surely (we call this the extinction time). In this paper, we investigate how the fragmentation process behaves as it approaches its extinction time. In particular, we prove a scaling limit for the block sizes which, as a direct consequence, gives us an expression for an invariant measure for the fragmentation process. In an earlier paper [Ann. Inst. Henri Poincar\textbackslash 'e Probab. Stat. 46 (2010) 338-368], we considered the same problem for another family of fragmentation processes, the so-called stable fragmentations. The results here are similar, but we emphasize that the methods used to prove them are different. Our approach in the present paper is based on Markov renewal theory and involves a somewhat unusual "spine" decomposition for the fragmentation, which may be of independent interest.},

The phase transition takes various forms, depending on the values of the parameters controlling the different types of hyperedges. It may be continuous as in a random graph. (In fact, when there are no higher-order edges, it is exactly the emergence of the giant component.) In this case, there is a sequence of possible sizes of ``components'' (including but not restricted to N\^\{2/3\}). Alternatively, the phase transition may be discontinuous. We are particularly interested in the nature of the discontinuous phase transition and are able to exhibit precise asymptotics. Our method extends a result of Aldous [Ann.

We collapse the hypergraph by running the following algorithm to exhaustion: pick a vertex having a 1-edge and remove it; collapse the hyperedges over that vertex onto their remaining vertices; repeat until there are no 1-edges left. We call the vertices removed in this process "identifiable". Also any hyperedge all of whose vertices are removed is called "identifiable". We say that a hyperedge is "essential" if its removal prior to collapse would have reduced the number of identifiable vertices. The limiting proportions, as N tends to infinity, of identifiable vertices and hyperedges were obtained by Darling and Norris. In this paper, we establish the limiting proportion of essential hyperedges. We also discuss, in the case of a random graph, the relation of essential edges to the 2-core of the graph, the maximal sub-graph with minimal vertex degree 2.},

  abstract = {Consider a uniform random rooted tree on vertices labelled by \$[n] = \textbackslash\{1,2,\textbackslash ldots,n\textbackslash\}\$, with edges directed towards the root. We imagine that each node of the tree has space for a single car to park. A number \$m \textbackslash le n\$ of cars arrive one by one, each at a node chosen independently and uniformly at random. If a car arrives at a space which is already occupied, it follows the unique path oriented towards the root until it encounters an empty space, in which case it parks there; if there is no empty space, it leaves the tree. Consider \$m =[\textbackslash alpha n]\$ and let \$A\_\{n,\textbackslash alpha\}\$ denote the event that all \$[\textbackslash alpha n]\$ cars find spaces in the tree. Lackner and Panholzer proved (via analytic combinatorics methods) that there is a phase transition in this model. Then if \$\textbackslash alpha \textbackslash le 1/2\$, we have \$\textbackslash mathbb\{P\}(A\_\{n,\textbackslash alpha\}) \textbackslash to \textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash sqrt\{1-2\textbackslash alpha\}\}\{1-\textbackslash alpha\}\$, whereas if \$\textbackslash alpha {$>$} 1/2\$ we have \$\textbackslash mathbb\{P\}(A\_\{n,\textbackslash alpha\}) \textbackslash to 0\$. We give a probabilistic explanation for this phenomenon, and an alternative proof via the objective method. Along the way, we are led to consider the following variant of the problem: take the tree to be the family tree of a Galton-Watson branching process with Poisson(1) offspring distribution, and let an independent Poisson(\$\textbackslash alpha\$) number of cars arrive at each vertex. Let \$X\$ be the number of cars which visit the root of the tree. Then for \$\textbackslash alpha \textbackslash le 1/2\$, we have \$\textbackslash mathbb\{E\}[X] \textbackslash leq 1\$, whereas for \$\textbackslash alpha {$>$} 1/2\$, we have \$\textbackslash mathbb\{E\}[X] = \textbackslash infty\$. This discontinuous phase transition turns out to be a generic phenomenon in settings with an arbitrary offspring distribution of mean at least 1 for the tree and arbitrary arrival distribution.},

We are interested in the strongly connected components of this directed graph. A phase transition for the emergence of a giant strongly connected component is known to occur at \$p = 1/n\$, with critical window \$p= 1/n + \textbackslash lambda n\^\{-4/3\}\$ for \$\textbackslash lambda \textbackslash in \textbackslash mathcal\{R\}\$.

The convergence occurs the sense of an \$\textbackslash ell\^1\$ sequence metric for which two directed multigraphs are close if there are compatible isomorphisms between their vertex and edge sets which roughly preserve the edge-lengths. Our proofs rely on a depth-first exploration of the graph which enables us to relate the strongly connected components to a particular spanning forest of the undirected Erd\textbackslash H\{o\}s-R\textbackslash 'enyi random graph \$G(n,p)\$, whose scaling limit is well understood. We show that the limiting sequence \$(\textbackslash mathcal\{C\}\_1,\textbackslash mathcal\{C\}\_2,\textbackslash ldots)\$ contains only finitely many components which are not loops.

We pick a uniform point from along the length and set it alight; the edges of the multigraph burn at speed 1. If the fire reaches a vertex of degree 2, the fire gets directly passed on to the neighbouring edge; a vertex of degree at least 3, however, passes the fire either to all of its neighbours or none, each with probability \$1/2\$. If the fire goes out before the whole network is burnt, we again set fire to a uniform point.

  abstract = {For \$\textbackslash alpha \textbackslash in (1,2]\$, the \$\textbackslash alpha\$-stable graph arises as the universal scaling limit of critical random graphs with i.i.d. degrees having a given \$\textbackslash alpha\$-dependent power-law tail behavior. It consists of a sequence of compact measured metric spaces (the limiting connected components), each of which is tree-like, in the sense that it consists of an \$\textbackslash mathbb R\$-tree with finitely many vertex-identifications (which create cycles). Indeed, given their masses and numbers of vertex-identifications, these components are independent and may be constructed from a spanning \$\textbackslash mathbb R\$-tree, which is a biased version of the \$\textbackslash alpha\$-stable tree, with a certain number of leaves glued along their paths to the root. In this paper we investigate the geometric properties of such a component with given mass and number of vertex-identifications. We (1) obtain the distribution of its kernel and more generally of its discrete finite-dimensional marginals; we will observe that these distributions are related to the distributions of some configuration models (2) determine the distribution of the \$\textbackslash alpha\$-stable graph as a collection of \$\textbackslash alpha\$-stable trees glued onto its kernel and (3) present a line-breaking construction, in the same spirit as Aldous' line-breaking construction of the Brownian continuum random tree.},

  abstract = {An introduction to a broad range of topics in deep learning, covering mathematical and conceptual background, deep learning techniques used in industry, and research perspectives. "Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject." -Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.},

It is an attempt to give a reasonably self-contained presentation of the basic theory of stochastic partial differential equations, taking for granted basic measure theory, functional analysis and probability theory, but nothing else. The approach taken in these notes is to focus on semilinear parabolic problems driven by additive noise. These can be treated as stochastic evolution equations in some infinite-dimensional Banach or Hilbert space that usually have nice regularising properties and they already form a very rich class of problems with many interesting properties. Furthermore, this class of problems has the advantage of allowing to completely pass under silence many subtle problems arising from stochastic integration in infinite-dimensional spaces.},

The text may also be useful in advanced courses and seminars, as well as for reference and individual study. Part I, consisting of 3 chapters, presents a general introduction to percolation, stating the main results, defining the central objects, and proving its main properties. No prior knowledge of percolation is assumed. Part II, consisting of Chapters 4\textendash 9, discusses mean-field critical behavior by describing the two main techniques used, namely, differential inequalities and the lace expansion. In Parts I and II, all results are proved, making this the first self-contained text discussing high-dimensional percolation. Part III, consisting of Chapters 10\textendash 13, describes recent progress in high-dimensional percolation. Partial proofs and substantial overviews of how the proofs are obtained are given. In many of these results, the lace expansion and differential inequalities or their discrete analogues are central. Part IV, consisting of Chapters 14\textendash 16, features related models and further open problems, with a focus on the big picture.},

  abstract = {The evolution of a deep neural network trained by the gradient descent can be described by its neural tangent kernel (NTK) as introduced in [20], where it was proven that in the infinite width limit the NTK converges to an explicit limiting kernel and it stays constant during training. The NTK was also implicit in some other recent papers [6,13,14]. In the overparametrization regime, a fully-trained deep neural network is indeed equivalent to the kernel regression predictor using the limiting NTK. And the gradient descent achieves zero training loss for a deep overparameterized neural network. However, it was observed in [5] that there is a performance gap between the kernel regression using the limiting NTK and the deep neural networks. This performance gap is likely to originate from the change of the NTK along training due to the finite width effect. The change of the NTK along the training is central to describe the generalization features of deep neural networks. In the current paper, we study the dynamic of the NTK for finite width deep fully-connected neural networks. We derive an infinite hierarchy of ordinary differential equations, the neural tangent hierarchy (NTH) which captures the gradient descent dynamic of the deep neural network. Moreover, under certain conditions on the neural network width and the data set dimension, we prove that the truncated hierarchy of NTH approximates the dynamic of the NTK up to arbitrary precision. This description makes it possible to directly study the change of the NTK for deep neural networks, and sheds light on the observation that deep neural networks outperform kernel regressions using the corresponding limiting NTK.},

Poised to stimulate research for years to come, this new work covers developments of the last decade, providing a much-needed, modern overview of this fast-growing area of combinatorics. Written by three highly respected members of the discrete mathematics community, the book incorporates many disparate results from across the literature, including results obtained by the authors and some completely new results. Current tools and techniques are also thoroughly emphasized. Clear, easily accessible presentations make Random Graphs an ideal introduction for newcomers to the field and an excellent reference for scientists interested in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science. Special features include: * A focus on the fundamental theory as well as basic models of random graphs * A detailed description of the phase transition phenomenon * Easy-to-apply exponential inequalities for large deviation bounds * An extensive study of the problem of containing small subgraphs * Results by Bollobas and others on the chromatic number of random graphs * The result by Robinson and Wormald on the existence of Hamilton cycles in random regular graphs * A gentle introduction to the zero-one laws * Ample exercises, figures, and bibliographic references},

Moreover, when the degree distributions have only finite mean we show that the elimination of self-loops and multiple edges does not significantly change the degree distributions in the resulting simple graph.},

  abstract = {In a random n-vertex digraph, each arc is present with probability p, independently of the presence or absence of other arcs. We investigate the structure of the strong components of a random digraph and present an algorithm for the construction of the transitive closure of a random digraph. We show that, when n is large and np is equal to a constant c greater than 1, it is very likely that all but one of the strong components are very small, and that the unique large strong component contains about {$\Theta$}2n vertices, where {$\Theta$} is the unique root in [0, 1] of the equation 1 - x - e-ex = 0. Nearly all the vertices outside the large strong component line in strong components of size 1. Provided that the expected degree of a vertex is bounded away from 1, our transitive closure algorithm runs in expected time O(n). for all choices of n and p, the expected execution time of the algorithm is O(w(n) (n log n)4/3), where w(n) is an arbitrary nondecreasing unbounded function. To circumvent the fact that the size of the transitive closure may be {$\Omega$}(n2) the algorithm presents the transitive closure in the compact form (A \texttimes{} B)U C, where A and B are sets of vertices, and C is a set of arcs.},

To this end, we rely on new local limit estimates for the probability that such random walks lie at time \$n\$ at value \$x\_\{n\}\$, where the latter can be arbitrary, encompassing in particular large deviation regimes. We believe both to be of independent interest. Then, thanks to well-known bijections, this allows us to study random maps sampled at random according to face degree weights and which are conditioned at the same time by their number of vertices, edges and faces. We establish several limit theorems as these three quantities tend to infinity, depending on their relative behaviour as well as on the weight sequence. By a direct application, we confirm the prediction of Fusy \& Guitter that typical distances in uniform random bipartite maps with \$n\$ edges and \$n\^\{b\}\$ faces, respectively \$n\$ edges and \$n\^\{c\}\$ vertices, are of order \$n\^\{(2-b)/4\}\$, respectively \$n\^\{c/4\}\$; furthermore we show that in both cases, the scaling limit is the celebrated Brownian map.},

Their application appears in the theory of many areas of classical and modern stochastic processes including storage models, renewal processes, insurance risk models, optimal stopping problems, mathematical finance, continuous-state branching processes and positive self-similar Markov processes.This textbook is based on a series of graduate courses concerning the theory and application of L\'evy processes from the perspective of their path fluctuations. Central to the presentation is the decomposition of paths in terms of excursions from the running maximum as well as an understanding of short- and long-term behaviour.The book aims to be mathematically rigorous while still providing an intuitive feel for underlying principles. The results and applications often focus on the case of L\'evy processes with jumps in only one direction, for which recent theoretical advances have yielded a higher degree of mathematical tractability.The second edition additionally addresses recent developments in the potential analysis of subordinators, Wiener-Hopf theory, the theory of scale functions and their application to ruin theory, as well as including an extensive overview of the classical and modern theory of positive self-similar Markov processes. Each chapter has a comprehensive set of exercises.},

These generalizations of curves and surfaces to arbitrarily many dimensions provide the mathematical context for under\- standing "space" in all of its manifestations. Today, the tools of manifold theory are indispensable in most major subfields of pure mathematics, and outside of pure mathematics they are becoming increasingly important to scientists in such diverse fields as genetics, robotics, econometrics, com\- puter graphics, biomedical imaging, and, of course, the undisputed leader among consumers (and inspirers) of mathematics-theoretical physics. No longer a specialized subject that is studied only by differential geometers, manifold theory is now one of the basic skills that all mathematics students should acquire as early as possible. Over the past few centuries, mathematicians have developed a wondrous collection of conceptual machines designed to enable us to peer ever more deeply into the invisible world of geometry in higher dimensions. Once their operation is mastered, these powerful machines enable us to think geometrically about the 6-dimensional zero set of a polynomial in four complex variables, or the lO-dimensional manifold of 5 x 5 orthogonal ma\- trices, as easily as we think about the familiar 2-dimensional sphere in ]R3.},

  abstract = {A longstanding goal in deep learning research has been to precisely characterize training and generalization. However, the often complex loss landscapes of neural networks have made a theory of learning dynamics elusive. In this work, we show that for wide neural networks the learning dynamics simplify considerably and that, in the infinite width limit, they are governed by a linear model obtained from the first-order Taylor expansion of the network around its initial parameters. Furthermore, mirroring the correspondence between wide Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian processes, gradient-based training of wide neural networks with a squared loss produces test set predictions drawn from a Gaussian process with a particular compositional kernel. While these theoretical results are only exact in the infinite width limit, we nevertheless find excellent empirical agreement between the predictions of the original network and those of the linearized version even for finite practically-sized networks. This agreement is robust across different architectures, optimization methods, and loss functions.},

Best constants in several inequalities, such as Young's inequality and the logarithmic Sobolev inequality, are also included. A thorough treatment of rearrangement inequalities and competing symmetries appears in book form for the first time. There is an extensive treatment of potential theory and its applications to quantum mechanics, which, again, is unique at this level. Uniform convexity of \$L\^p\$ space is treated very carefully. The presentation of this important subject is highly unusual for a textbook. All the proofs provide deep insights into the theorems. This book sets a new standard for a graduate textbook in analysis. --Shing-Tung Yau, Harvard University For some number of years, Rudin's ``Real and Complex'', and a few other analysis books, served as the canonical choice for the book to use, and to teach from, in a first year grad analysis course. Lieb-Loss offers a refreshing alternative: It begins with a down-to-earth intro to measure theory, \$L\^p\$ and all that ... It aims at a wide range of essential applications, such as the Fourier transform, and series, inequalities, distributions, and Sobolev spaces--PDE, potential theory, calculus of variations, and math physics (Schrodinger's equation, the hydrogen atom, Thomas-Fermi theory ... to mention a few). The book should work equally well in a one-, or in a two-semester course. The first half of the book covers the basics, and the rest will be great for students to have, regardless of whether or not it gets to be included in a course. --Palle E. T.

The relation of Brownian motion and random walk is explored from several viewpoints, including a development of the theory of Brownian local times from random walk embeddings. Stochastic integration is introduced as a tool and an accessible treatment of the potential theory of Brownian motion clears the path for an extensive treatment of intersections of Brownian paths. An investigation of exceptional points on the Brownian path and an appendix on SLE processes, by Oded Schramm and Wendelin Werner, lead directly to recent research themes.},

In this paper we develop in detail the theory of random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions. In addition to simple undirected, unipartite graphs, we examine the properties of directed and bipartite graphs. Among other results, we derive exact expressions for the position of the phase transition at which a giant component first forms, the mean component size, the size of the giant component if there is one, the mean number of vertices a certain distance away from a randomly chosen vertex, and the average vertex-vertex distance within a graph. We apply our theory to some real-world graphs, including the world-wide web and collaboration graphs of scientists and Fortune 1000 company directors. We demonstrate that in some cases random graphs with appropriate distributions of vertex degree predict with surprising accuracy the behavior of the real world, while in others there is a measurable discrepancy between theory and reality, perhaps indicating the presence of additional social structure in the network that is not captured by the random graph., This article appears in the following collections:},

  abstract = {It has been 15 years since the first edition of Stochastic Integration and Differential Equations, A New Approach appeared, and in those years many other texts on the same subject have been published, often with connections to applications, especially mathematical finance. Yet in spite of the apparent simplicity of approach, none of these books has used the functional analytic method of presenting semimartingales and stochastic integration. Thus a 2nd edition seems worthwhile and timely, though it is no longer appropriate to call it "a new approach". The new edition has several significant changes, most prominently the addition of exercises for solution. These are intended to supplement the text, but lemmas needed in a proof are never relegated to the exercises. Many of the exercises have been tested by graduate students at Purdue and Cornell Universities. Chapter 3 has been completely redone, with a new, more intuitive and simultaneously elementary proof of the fundamental Doob-Meyer decomposition theorem, the more general version of the Girsanov theorem due to Lenglart, the Kazamaki-Novikov criteria for exponential local martingales to be martingales, and a modern treatment of compensators. Chapter 4 treats sigma martingales (important in finance theory) and gives a more comprehensive treatment of martingale representation, including both the Jacod-Yor theory and Emery\~A\textcent\^A{$\lnot$}(tm)s examples of martingales that actually have martingale representation (thus going beyond the standard cases of Brownian motion and the compensated Poisson process). New topics added include an introduction to the theory of the expansion of filtrations, a treatment of the Fefferman martingale inequality, and that the dual space of the martingale space H\^1 can be identified with BMO martingales. Solutions to selected exercises are available at the web site of the author, with current URL http://www.orie.cornell.edu/\textasciitilde protter/books.html.},

If \$\textbackslash alpha\_n = \textbackslash operatorname\{med\} S\_n\$, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for this. An important corollary is a one-sided version of the Hartman-Wintner law of the iterated logarithm: if \$E(X\^+)\^2 {$<$} \textbackslash infty\$, then it is always possible to find such a norming sequence. Explicit norming sequences are given which are easy to obtain. Necessary and sufficient conditions are also given for being able to find a norming sequence \$\textbackslash\{\textbackslash beta\_n\textbackslash\}\$ for the two-sided problem \$(\textbackslash lim \textbackslash sup \textbackslash beta\^\{-1\}\_n |S\_n - \textbackslash alpha\_n| = c\$ a.s.) when \$\textbackslash alpha\_n = ES\_n\$ and \$\textbackslash alpha\_n = 0\$. The two-sided problem with \$\textbackslash alpha\_n = \textbackslash operatorname\{med\} S\_n\$ was solved by Kesten. The one-sided problem remains open for \$\textbackslash alpha\_n = ES\_n\$ and \$\textbackslash alpha\_n = 0\$. Examples are given which illustrate the advantage of considering different centering sequences. A one-sided version of Strassen's converse to the law of the iterated logarithm is also given: if \$\textbackslash lim \textbackslash sup S\_n/ \textbackslash sqrt\{2n \textbackslash log \textbackslash log n\} = 1\$ a.s., then \$EX = 0, EX\^2 = 1\$.},

  abstract = {Machine learning, and in particular neural network models, have revolutionized fields such as image, text, and speech recognition. Today, many important real-world applications in these areas are driven by neural networks. There are also growing applications in engineering, robotics, medicine, and finance. Despite their immense success in practice, there is limited mathematical understanding of neural networks. This paper illustrates how neural networks can be studied via stochastic analysis, and develops approaches for addressing some of the technical challenges which arise. We analyze one-layer neural networks in the asymptotic regime of simultaneously (A) large network sizes and (B) large numbers of stochastic gradient descent training iterations. We rigorously prove that the empirical distribution of the neural network parameters converges to the solution of a nonlinear partial differential equation. This result can be considered a law of large numbers for neural networks. In addition, a consequence of our analysis is that the trained parameters of the neural network asymptotically become independent, a property which is commonly called "propagation of chaos".},

These references are to a supplementary bibliography, whose items are referred to as [S1] through [S26]. A thorough revision was not attempted. The development of the subject in the last decade would have required a treatment in a much more general con\- text. It is true that a number of interesting questions remain open in the concrete setting of random walk on the integers. (See [S 19] for a recent survey). On the other hand, much of the material of this book (foundations, fluctuation theory, renewal theorems) is now available in standard texts, e.g. Feller [S9], Breiman [S1], Chung [S4] in the more general setting of random walk on the real line. But the major new development since the first edition occurred in 1969, when D. Ornstein [S22] and C. J. Stone [S26] succeeded in extending the recurrent potential theory in{$\cdot$} Chapters II and VII from the integers to the reals. By now there is an extensive and nearly complete potential theory of recurrent random walk on locally compact groups, Abelian ( [S20], [S25]) as well as non\- Abelian ( [S17], [S2] ). Finally, for the non-specialist there exists now an unsurpassed brief introduction to probabilistic potential theory, in the context of simple random walk and Brownian motion, by Dynkin and Yushkevich [S8].},

Schilder wrote his thesis. and so it may be considered chance that I chose to use his result as a jumping off point; with only minor variations. everything else in these sections is taken from Azencott. In particular. section 3) is little more than a rewrite of his exoposition of the Cramer theory via the ideas of Bahadur and Zabel. Furthermore. the brief treatment which I have given to the Ventsel-Freidlin theory in section 4) is again based on Azencott's ideas. All in all. the biggest difference between his and my exposition of these topics is the language in which we have written. However. another major difference must be mentioned: his bibliography is extensive and constitutes a fine introduction to the available literature. mine shares neither of these attributes. Starting with section 5).},

Monge in the 18th century, which has made breathtaking forays into various other domains of mathematics ever since. The author presents a broad overview of this area, supplying complete and self-contained proofs of all the fundamental results of the theory of optimal transport at the appropriate level of generality. Thus, the book encompasses the broad spectrum ranging from basic theory to the most recent research results. PhD students or researchers can read the entire book without any prior knowledge of the field. A comprehensive bibliography with notes that extensively discuss the existing literature underlines the book's value as a most welcome reference text on this subject.},

We study the percolation phase transition on such graphs G , i.e ., the emergence as p increases of a unique giant component in the random subgraph G [ p ] obtained by keeping edges independently with probability p . More generally, we study the emergence of a giant component in G ( d ) itself as d varies. We show that a single method can be used to prove very precise results below, inside and above the ‘scaling window’ of the phase transition, matching many of the known results for the much simpler model G ( n , p ). This method is a natural extension of that used by Bollobás and the author to study G ( n , p ), itself based on work of Aldous and of Nachmias and Peres; the calculations are significantly more involved in the present setting.},

abstract = {We study the critical behavior of the component sizes for the configuration model when the tail of the degree distribution of a randomly chosen vertex is a regularly-varying function with exponent $\tau -1$, where $\tau \in (3,4)$. The component sizes are shown to be of the order $n^{(\tau -2)/(\tau -1)}L(n)^{-1}$ for some slowly-varying function $L(\cdot )$. We show that the re-scaled ordered component sizes converge in distribution to the ordered excursions of a thinned Lévy process. This proves that the scaling limits for the component sizes for these heavy-tailed configuration models are in a different universality class compared to the Erdos–Rényi random graphs. Also the joint re-scaled vector of ordered component sizes and their surplus edges is shown to have a distributional limit under a strong topology. Our proof resolves a conjecture by Joseph (Ann. Appl. Probab. 24 (2014) 2560–2594) about the scaling limits of uniform simple graphs with i.i.d. degrees in the critical window,...},

abstract = {We investigate the component sizes of the critical configuration model, as well as the related problem of critical percolation on a supercritical configuration model. We show that, at criticality, the finite third moment assumption on the asymptotic degree distribution is enough to guarantee that the sizes of the largest connected components are of the order $n^{2/3}$ and the re-scaled component sizes (ordered in a decreasing manner) converge to the ordered excursion lengths of an inhomogeneous Brownian Motion with a parabolic drift. We use percolation to study the evolution of these component sizes while passing through the critical window and show that the vector of percolation cluster-sizes, considered as a process in the critical window, converge to the multiplicative coalescent process in the sense of finite dimensional distributions. This behavior was first observed for Erdős-Rényi random graphs by Aldous (1997) and our results provide support for the empirical evidences that the nature of the phase transition for a wide array of random-graph models are universal in nature. Further, we show that the re-scaled component sizes and surplus edges converge jointly under a strong topology, at each fixed location of the scaling window.},

The scaling limit of the critical percolation clusters, viewed as measured metric spaces, was established in [7] with respect to the Gromov-weak topology. Our result extends those scaling limit results to the stronger Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov topology under slightly stronger assumptions on the degree distribution. This implies the distributional convergence of global functionals such as the diameter of the largest critical components. Further, our result gives a sufficient condition for compactness of the random metric spaces that arise as scaling limits of critical clusters in the heavy-tailed regime.},
